So we (Roclab) redesigned the University of Rochester's Course Description/Course Scheduler page (https://cdcs.ur.rochester.edu/) to become more user friendly. I mean, just look at their website...it looks like it hasn't been updated since the early 2000s! Someone needed to do something about it, right?

**The actual repository containing all our code is private and is only shared among the dev team. However, you can still check out our website here!!**
